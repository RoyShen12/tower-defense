if you can not open the above link, the most possible reason is that your browser does not support the latest [Class-properties-Feature](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-plugin-proposal-class-properties), check the after-babel-converted version [tower-defense](https://royshen12.github.io/tower-defense/babel-dist/).
